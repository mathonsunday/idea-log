# Idea Log

A personal repository for capturing project ideas, paths explored, and decisions made — so nothing gets lost.

## Structure

- `ideas/` — Project ideas and opportunities identified
- `explored/` — Paths investigated and what was learned
- `parked/` — Ideas evaluated and intentionally set aside (with reasoning)

## Entry Format

Each entry is a markdown file named `YYYY-MM-DD-short-title.md` using the template below.

## Quick Start

Copy `templates/entry.md` and fill it in:

```
cp templates/entry.md ideas/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-my-idea.md
```
